#  Handwritten Digit Recognition using Python & EasyOCR

##  Project Overview  
This project implements a **Handwritten Digit Recognition System** using **Python, OpenCV, and EasyOCR**. The system takes an **input image containing handwritten digits of any color, background, and font style** and automatically detects and recognizes the digits without requiring any manual cropping or segmentation.

The project applies **image preprocessing techniques** to enhance digit clarity and improve recognition accuracy. The recognized digits are displayed **line-by-line in the same format as they appear in the input image**.

This project is developed as a **mini-project assignment for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI & ML)** subject and is suitable for **beginners learning OCR and image processing concepts**.
